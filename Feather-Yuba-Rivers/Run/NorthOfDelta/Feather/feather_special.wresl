!!! Special Feather River Fish Criteria for Oct 15 - Nov 30 @ CP203
/*
Criteria being modeled:

If during the period of October 15 thru November 30, the flow in the Feather River at C.P. 203 is greater than
2500 cfs (except for flood release purposes), then the flow at C.P. 203 may not be less than 500 cfs below the
existing flow until after March 30.


How the Criteria is modeled:

The criteria only applies to a part of the month of October, so the trigger flow of 2500 cfs is flow weighted for
the entire month.  To compensate for the other half of the month that has no trigger, the trigger applied to the
entire month of October may be greater than 2500 cfs.  The triggers for October and November can be set in
'feather_fish_203.table'.

When the trigger is exceeded, a "price" must be paid (a minflow thru March as opposed to no minflow if the trigger
is not exceeded).  To avoid paying this price, releases for exports should be reduced to get below the trigger.
Releases to meet in-basin uses however, should never be reduced to get below the trigger.

If releases for flood control are made then no minimum flow is applied.
*/

!      In October and November, try to keep flow at CP203 < trigger otherwise pay the price
!      of a minflow(=OCT flow or NOV flow - 500cfs) through March.  Do this by reducing releases for exports if necessary.
!      If trigger is exceeded because of flood spills then no minflow is applied.


!Example:       month   C203 flow scenario        minflow
!       OCT     BELOW TRIGGER                     0 CFS =>  CHECK TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NOVEMBER
!       OCT     ABOVE TRIGGER DUE TO FLOOD        0 CFS =>  CHECK TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NOVEMBER
!       OCT     ABOVE TRIGGER                     C203 FLOW - 500 CFS  (NOV - MARCH)
!       NOV     BELOW TRIGGER                     0 CFS
!       NOV     ABOVE TRIGGER DUE TO FLOOD        0 CFS
!       NOV     ABOVE TRIGGER                     C203 FLOW - 500 CFS  (DEC - MARCH)
